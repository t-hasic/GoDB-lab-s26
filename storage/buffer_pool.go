// BufferPool manages the reading and writing of database pages between the DiskFileManager and memory.
// It acts as a central cache to keep "hot" pages in memory with fixed capacity and selectively evicts
// pages to disk when the pool becomes full. Users will need to coordinate concurrent access to pages
// using page-level latches and metadata (which you should define in page.go). All methods
// must be thread-safe, as multiple threads will request the same or different pages concurrently.
// To get full credit, you likely need to do better than coarse-grained latching (i.e., a global latch for the entire
// BufferPool instance).
